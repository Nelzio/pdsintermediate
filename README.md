# Mpesa Payment intermediate

Project created by the difficulty encountered with PaymentsDS when used directly on the frontend.

The project does not follow any pattern design that developers knows, I just structured it "institutionally" to facilitate myself in code organization. The CORS error.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

# PaymentsDS config
Create `.env` file in the root path and past the following text with your own keys

```bash
API_KEY='<you_api_key>'
PUBLIC_KEY='<you_public_key>'
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CODE='<you_provider>'
```

## Run project
```bash
node app.js
```
